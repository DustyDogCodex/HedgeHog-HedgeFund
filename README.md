    Welcome to Hedgehog Hedgefund! This is a simple and customizable web application built using React and styled with Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap. The website is created for a fictional company called Hedgehog Hedgefund but can easily be customized to suit a wide variety of applications. The React Bootstrap Project combines React with Bootstrap, a widely-used CSS framework for designing responsive and mobile-first websites. This project aims to display my skills as a developer that can build web applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing.
